### Overview
First of all, thanks for your interest in helping make SimpleMDE even better. Contributions help resolve rare bugs, accomplish neat new features, polish the code, and improve the documentation.

### Guidelines for contributing
- The *most important* guideline for contributing is to compare against the `development` branch when creating a pull request. This allows time to test and modify code changes before merging them into the stable master branch with the next release.
- If you really want to earn some brownie points, create a JSFiddle that demonstrates your code changes. Seriously, this helps immensely and allows one or multiple people to easily provide feedback on the great work you've done.
  - When creating the JSFiddle, keep in mind that you can use http://rawgit.com for your files.
- Do your best to fully test your changes. Anticipate edge-case behavior.
- Try to keep your codebase that you're making changes to as up-to-date as possible with the origin. SimpleMDE creates new releases frequently, so it's easy to fall behind if you've been working on something new for a while.
